I"Œ<p>This is my first post in Jekyll!  I actually heard about this blogging tech from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@jackrhysider</code>, the infosec guru that he is.  He uses it for his own personal blog and I decided to give it a whirl for me as well. Iâ€™ve never found another piece of tech that gives good functionality and also minimal upkeep needed.</p>

<p>So far, Iâ€™ve only played with the basic setup and this post!  Going to explore some formatting next!  Not sure what aesthetic I want yet so weâ€™ll see what the internet has to offer.</p>

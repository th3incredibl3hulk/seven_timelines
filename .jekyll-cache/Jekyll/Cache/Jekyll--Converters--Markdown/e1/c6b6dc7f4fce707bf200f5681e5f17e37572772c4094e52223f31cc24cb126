I"!<p>This is my first post in Jekyll!  I actually heard about this blogging tech from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@jackrhysider</code>, the infosec guru that he is.  He uses it for his own personal blog and I decided to give it a whirl for me as well. I’ve never found another piece of tech that gives good functionality and also minimal upkeep needed.</p>

<p>So far, I’ve only played with the basic setup and this post!  Going to explore some formatting next!  Not sure what aesthetic I want yet so we’ll see what the internet has to offer.</p>

<p>Where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR</code> is a four-digit number, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MONTH</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DAY</code> are both two-digit numbers, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MARKUP</code> is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.</p>

<p>Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Hi, </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
<span class="n">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Tom'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1">#=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.</span></code></pre></figure>

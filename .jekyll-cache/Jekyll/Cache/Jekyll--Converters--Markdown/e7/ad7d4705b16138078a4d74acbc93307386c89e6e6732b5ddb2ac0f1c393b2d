I"c<p>This is my first post in Jekyll!  I actually heard about this blogging tech from <a href="https://twitter.com/JackRhysider">@jackrhysider</a>, the infosec guru that he is.  He uses it for his own personal blog and I decided to give it a whirl for me as well. I’ve never found another piece of tech that gives good functionality and also minimal upkeep needed.</p>

<p>So far, I’ve only played with the basic setup and this post!  Going to explore some formatting next!  Not sure what aesthetic I want yet so we’ll see what the internet has to offer.</p>

<p>Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll">Jekyll’s GitHub repo</a>. If you have questions, you can ask them on <a href="https://talk.jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll Talk</a>.</p>

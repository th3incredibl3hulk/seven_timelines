DRAFT FOR MAME CABINET AFTER I'VE ACTUALLY HAD TO MAKE DECISIONS

Actual cabinet material

### Actual Cabinet Material
This has weirdly been the hardest part so far. I really cannot make up my mind here though that's probably because I've chosen to complicate it. Once again, you need to decide what you want and pick a material that will achieve that.

#### Refurb or new?
There are lots of opinions here but you need to decide for yourself if you want the hassle of refurbishing an old original cabinet or the hassle of making a new cabinet.  Old cabinets are going to have lots of wires, projection screens, probably arcade quality sticks/buttons and those cute coin slots.  New cabinets can either be purchased as prefab kits you just assemble or you can make your own custom cuts.  Of course, with new cabinets you can do whatever you want but that requires more thinking.  How much do you want to think?

#### Cost and style
Cost matters a LOT here as you are likely to spend a decent chunk of your budget on the cabinet material.  An old cabinet can range DRAMATICALLY depending on condition and I recommend Craigslist or its ilk as the best place to research these.  I've seen $25 up to $1,000 for a dead cabinet.  The biggest "risk" here is that you'll probably have to wait for the right cabinet to come along before you can get started.

If you're building new, there are so many options.  Firstly, you can buy a prefab cab.  Something like this [$650 cab][cabinet-prefab] could work but honestly, a lot of these manufacturers seem short-lived so you are likely to need to look on your own here.  I found a bunch of options on [Etsy][etsy] as well.  I don't have a good recommendation because I gave up and elected to build my own.

When building your own, my suggestion: let your imagination run.  I originally planned a classic 4P from plywood but the more I research the more I'm open to new ideas.  [There][rcade1] [are][rcade2] [so][rcade3] [many][rcade4] [options][rcade5] [it's][rcade6] [ridiculous][rcade7]....[frankly][rcade8].  Yeah, each word there is a different r/cade example cabinet.  Look at each one and see just SOME of your choices.  Costs range enormously here as you can imagine but that's why you need to know what you want, first.

#### Weight
One thing few people think about is weight. When considering plywood, my main hesitancy was the weight.  If you use 1/2 inch plywood, you're going to have to use super small screws (how heavy is your hardware?). If you use 3/4 inch plywood, you're probably not moving your cabinet again.  Plastic is light but hard to mold.  Plexiglass is pretty durable and a cool aesthetic but you have to cut it. Metal? I hope you have a shop/torch/other stuff I don't even have experience with.

#### Other 
One last thing: the cabinet is important to think about it. Do you need mold resistance? Do you want it to be modular so you can take it apart and move it? Must it look cool or show off your sweet underlighting or take a custom decal you printed?  Consider what the cabinet must do for you and what it must NOT do when planning.
